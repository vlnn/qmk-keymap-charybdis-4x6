# Charybdis (4x6) customized keymap

This is my config to use with [Charybdis, the split keyboard](https://bastardkb.com/charybdis/).

## Dependency
EN/UA language switches via karabiner-elements special rule, that binds F13 to English layout and F14 to Ukrainian one. You have to configure your OS to support this settings (any two languages, actually, in any order -- keyboard will just send F13 or F14 key codes).

## Legacy docs from the maker

The Charydbis (4x6) default keymap is inspired from the original [Dactyl Manuform](../../../../../handwired/dactyl_manuform) default keymap.

This layout supports RGB matrix. However, due to space constraints on the MCU, only a limited number of effect can be enabled at once. Look at the `config.h` file and enable your favorite effect.
