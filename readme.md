The Charydbis (4x6) default keymap is inspired from the original [Dactyl Manuform](../../../../../handwired/dactyl_manuform) default keymap.

This layout supports RGB matrix. However, due to space constraints on the MCU, only a limited number of effect can be enabled at once. Look at the `config.h` file and enable your favorite effect.
